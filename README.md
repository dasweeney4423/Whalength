# Whalength
Repository for the supplementary material of Frontiers article: Inexpensive Aerial Photogrammetry for Studies of Whales and Large Marine Animals (Front. Mar. Sci., 15 November 2017 | https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2017.00366).

This contains code from https://github.com/EvaLeunissen/Whalength ammended with the help of Jordan Lerma (https://github.com/jordkl) to best fit METR's needs. The arduino code has been altered to read from the different gps units and to account for different IMU positions. The whalength.m app has been changed to include input of whaleID during measuring.
